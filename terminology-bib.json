However, while such correlates are important for progress to occur, they are not enough if we are to understand even basic facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not, though it has even more neurons and appears to be just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of little help in many instances where we would like to know if consciousness is present: patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To address these issues, we need not only more data but also a theory of consciousness—one that says what experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated information theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover, IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory findings, makes a number of testable predictions and extrapolates to a number of problematic conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a fundamental property possessed by physical systems having specific causal properties. It predicts that consciousness is graded, is common among biological organisms and can occur in some very simple systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor are aggregates such as groups of individuals or heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their behaviour were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.

This is just one of many areas where exponential advances in technology signal both hope and fear, leading to public controversy. This book shows that many debates over new technologies are framed in the context of risks to moral values, human health, and environmental safety. But it argues that behind these legitimate concerns often lie deeper, but unacknowledged, socioeconomic considerations. Technological tensions are often heightened by perceptions that the benefits of new technologies will accrue only to small sections of society while the risks will be more widely distributed. Similarly, innovations that threaten to alter cultural identities tend to generate intense social concern. As such, societies that exhibit great economic and political inequities are likely to experience heightened technological controversies. Drawing from nearly 600 years of technology history, Innovation and Its Enemies identifies the tension between the need for innovation and the pressure to maintain continuity, social order, and stability as one of today's biggest policy challenges. It reveals the extent to which modern technological controversies grow out of distrust in public and private institutions. Using detailed case studies of coffee, the printing press, margarine, farm mechanization, electricity, mechanical refrigeration, recorded music, transgenic crops, and transgenic animals, it shows how new technologies emerge, take root, and create new institutional ecologies that favor their establishment in the marketplace. The book uses these lessons from history to contextualize contemporary debates surrounding technologies such as artificial intelligence, online learning, 3D printing, gene editing, robotics, drones, and renewable energy. It ultimately makes the case for shifting greater responsibility to public leaders to work with scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to manage technological change, make associated institutional adjustments, and expand public engagement on scientific and technological matters.","author":[{"given":"Calestous","family":"Juma"}],"DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190467036.001.0001","type":"book","id":"Juma2016","citation-key":"Juma2016","ISBN":"9780190467036","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190467036.001.0001"},{"author":[{"given":"M.","family":"Gurri"}],"type":"book","id":"gurri2018","citation-key":"gurri2018","ISBN":"9781732265141","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"Stripe Press","title":"The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium","URL":"https://books.google.fr/books?id=qD-1vAEACAAJ"},{"author":[{"given":"E.","family":"Morozov"}],"type":"book","id":"morozov2013","citation-key":"morozov2013","ISBN":"9781610391399","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher":"PublicAffairs","title":"To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism","URL":"https://books.google.fr/books?id=fdggBahA1qsC"},{"container-title":"Le Monde Diplomatique","author":[{"given":"Evgeny","family":"Morozov"}],"type":"article-journal","id":"morozov20258","citation-key":"morozov20258","issue":"857","issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,8]]},"title":"Le numérique nous ramène-t-il au Moyen Age ?","volume":"72"},{"author":[{"given":"Evgeny","family":"Morozov"}],"type":"document","id":"morozov20254","citation-key":"morozov20254","issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,4]]},"title":"The New Legislators of Silicon Valley","URL":"https://www.theideasletter.org/essay/silicon-valleys-new-legislators/"},{"author":[{"given":"Lance","family":"Gore"}],"type":"document","id":"gore2024","citation-key":"gore2024","issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,1]]},"title":"Can Silicon Valley offer Chinese socialism a window into the future?","URL":"https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/can-silicon-valley-offer-chinese-socialism-window-future"},{"author":[{"given":"Virginia","family":"Postrel"}],"type":"book","id":"postrel2011","citation-key":"postrel2011","ISBN":"9781439135327","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"publisher":"Free Press","title":"The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise,","URL":"https://books.google.sn/books?id=wcPVTSUTZvMC"},{"publisher-place":"New York","author":[{"given":"Neven","family":"Sesardić"}],"type":"book","id":"Sesardic2016","citation-key":"Sesardic2016","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"publisher":"Encounter Books","title":"When Reason Goes on Holiday: Philosophers in Politics"},{"author":[{"given":"Curtis","family":"Yarvin"}],"type":"document","id":"yarvin2007","citation-key":"yarvin2007","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,4]]},"title":"A Formalist Manifesto","URL":"https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted/"},{"author":[{"given":"Peter","family":"Thiel"}],"type":"document","id":"Thiel2009","citation-key":"Thiel2009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"title":"The Education of a Libertarian","URL":"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/"},{"author":[{"given":"Sam","family":"Altman"}],"type":"document","id":"Altman2021","citation-key":"Altman2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"title":"Moore's Law for Everything","URL":"https://moores.samaltman.com/"},{"author":[{"given":"Thorstein","family":"Veblen"},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Bell"}],"DOI":"10.4324/9781351304207","type":"book","id":"Veblen1921","citation-key":"Veblen1921","ISBN":"9781351304207","issued":{"date-parts":[[1921,7]]},"publisher":"Routledge","title":"The Engineers and the Price System","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781351304207"},{"author":[{"given":"E.","family":"Bellamy"}],"type":"book","id":"bellamy1888","citation-key":"bellamy1888","ISBN":"9781557095060","issued":{"date-parts":[[1888]]},"publisher":"Applewood Books","title":"Looking Backward: From 2000 to 1887","URL":"https://books.google.fr/books?id=xpHtvz4bNZ0C"},{"publisher-place":"Berkeley, Calif. ;

Arguing for a return to true liberal values, this engaging and accessible book develops, defends, and demonstrates how embracing the ideas first espoused by eighteenth-century philosophers like Locke, Smith, Voltaire, and Wollstonecraft is good for everyone. With her trademark wit and deep understanding, McCloskey shows how the adoption of Enlightenment ideals of liberalism has propelled the freedom and prosperity that define the quality of a full life. In her view, liberalism leads to equality, but equality does not necessarily lead to liberalism. Liberalism is an optimistic philosophy that depends on the power of rhetoric rather than coercion, and on ethics, free speech, and facts in order to thrive.
