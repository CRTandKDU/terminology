                  Technologies},
  publisher =	 {Oxford University Press},
  year =	 2016,
  month =	 08,
  abstract =	 {The rise of artificial intelligence has rekindled a
                  long-standing debate on the impact of technology on
                  employment. This is just one of many areas where
                  exponential advances in technology signal both hope
                  and fear, leading to public controversy. This book
                  shows that many debates over new technologies are
                  framed in the context of risks to moral values,
                  human health, and environmental safety. But it
                  argues that behind these legitimate concerns often
                  lie deeper, but unacknowledged, socioeconomic
                  considerations. Technological tensions are often
                  heightened by perceptions that the benefits of new
                  technologies will accrue only to small sections of
                  society while the risks will be more widely
                  distributed. Similarly, innovations that threaten to
                  alter cultural identities tend to generate intense
                  social concern. As such, societies that exhibit
                  great economic and political inequities are likely
                  to experience heightened technological
                  controversies. Drawing from nearly 600 years of
                  technology history, Innovation and Its Enemies
                  identifies the tension between the need for
                  innovation and the pressure to maintain continuity,
                  social order, and stability as one of today's
                  biggest policy challenges. It reveals the extent to
                  which modern technological controversies grow out of
                  distrust in public and private institutions. Using
                  detailed case studies of coffee, the printing press,
                  margarine, farm mechanization, electricity,
                  mechanical refrigeration, recorded music, transgenic
                  crops, and transgenic animals, it shows how new
                  technologies emerge, take root, and create new
                  institutional ecologies that favor their
                  establishment in the marketplace. The book uses
                  these lessons from history to contextualize
                  contemporary debates surrounding technologies such
                  as artificial intelligence, online learning, 3D
                  printing, gene editing, robotics, drones, and
                  renewable energy. It ultimately makes the case for
                  shifting greater responsibility to public leaders to
                  work with scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs
                  to manage technological change, make associated
                  institutional adjustments, and expand public
                  engagement on scientific and technological matters.},
