  abstract =	 { The science of consciousness has made great strides
                  by focusing on the behavioural and neuronal
                  correlates of experience. However, while such
                  correlates are important for progress to occur, they
                  are not enough if we are to understand even basic
                  facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives
                  rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not,
                  though it has even more neurons and appears to be
                  just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of
                  little help in many instances where we would like to
                  know if consciousness is present: patients with a
                  few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm
                  infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are
                  rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing
                  faces and objects, and answering difficult
                  questions. To address these issues, we need not only
                  more data but also a theory of consciousness—one
                  that says what experience is and what type of
                  physical systems can have it. Integrated information
                  theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience
                  itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic
                  existence, composition, information, integration and
                  exclusion. From these it derives five postulates
                  about the properties required of physical mechanisms
                  to support consciousness. The theory provides a
                  principled account of both the quantity and the
                  quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a
                  calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular
                  physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover,
                  IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory
                  findings, makes a number of testable predictions and
                  extrapolates to a number of problematic
                  conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a
                  fundamental property possessed by physical systems
                  having specific causal properties. It predicts that
                  consciousness is graded, is common among biological
                  organisms and can occur in some very simple
                  systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward
                  networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor
                  are aggregates such as groups of individuals or
                  heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread
                  functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital
                  computers, even if their behaviour were to be
                  functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they
                  were to run faithful simulations of the human brain,
                  would experience next to nothing. }

                  Technologies},
  publisher =	 {Oxford University Press},
  year =	 2016,
  month =	 08,
  abstract =	 {The rise of artificial intelligence has rekindled a
                  long-standing debate on the impact of technology on
                  employment. This is just one of many areas where
                  exponential advances in technology signal both hope
                  and fear, leading to public controversy. This book
                  shows that many debates over new technologies are
                  framed in the context of risks to moral values,
                  human health, and environmental safety. But it
                  argues that behind these legitimate concerns often
                  lie deeper, but unacknowledged, socioeconomic
                  considerations. Technological tensions are often
                  heightened by perceptions that the benefits of new
                  technologies will accrue only to small sections of
                  society while the risks will be more widely
                  distributed. Similarly, innovations that threaten to
                  alter cultural identities tend to generate intense
                  social concern. As such, societies that exhibit
                  great economic and political inequities are likely
                  to experience heightened technological
                  controversies. Drawing from nearly 600 years of
                  technology history, Innovation and Its Enemies
                  identifies the tension between the need for
                  innovation and the pressure to maintain continuity,
                  social order, and stability as one of today's
                  biggest policy challenges. It reveals the extent to
                  which modern technological controversies grow out of
                  distrust in public and private institutions. Using
                  detailed case studies of coffee, the printing press,
                  margarine, farm mechanization, electricity,
                  mechanical refrigeration, recorded music, transgenic
                  crops, and transgenic animals, it shows how new
                  technologies emerge, take root, and create new
                  institutional ecologies that favor their
                  establishment in the marketplace. The book uses
                  these lessons from history to contextualize
                  contemporary debates surrounding technologies such
                  as artificial intelligence, online learning, 3D
                  printing, gene editing, robotics, drones, and
                  renewable energy. It ultimately makes the case for
                  shifting greater responsibility to public leaders to
                  work with scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs
                  to manage technological change, make associated
                  institutional adjustments, and expand public
                  engagement on scientific and technological matters.},
